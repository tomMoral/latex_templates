	In this chapter, we describe the convolutional representation framework and present
	state-of-the-art algorithms used to compute such representations. The convolutional
	representation has been used to compute unsupervised representations of signals
	in various fields and is well adapted to study physiological signals. There are multiple
	methods to compute such representation, due to the independence of the different computation
	blocks involved in embedding the data or updating the patterns. We present here a unified
	view of these different blocks.
