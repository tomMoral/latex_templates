\chapter*{Acknowledgement}


Foremost, I would like to thank my advisors, Nicolas Vayatis and Laurent Oudre, for
their support during these three years. They gave me the perfect environment to develop
my ideas and the wonderful opportunity to work on exciting real life projects. Thanks
to both of you for making these three years such a interesting time in my life,
for your encouragements and for the many opportunities and collaborations you
made possible.

I would like to thank Julien Mairal, Stéphane Mallat and René Vidal for
doing me the honor of reviewing this manuscript and for their insightful
comments that helped me improve its quality. I am also grateful to
Stéphanie Allassonnière, Alexandre Gramfort and Pierre-Paul Vidal for
accepting to be part of the jury.

My gratitude also goes to the people who participated, directly or not,
to the elaboration of this thesis, and in particular my co-authors
Joan Bruna and Julien Audiffren, with whom I enjoyed working and discussing
the ideas we developed. It has also been a pleasure to work with Olivier
Grisel, who taught so much and continue to do so during our Fridays coding
sessions, and with whom I enjoyed sharing all these tiramisus.

I would also like to express my gratitude to all the people from the Cognac-G team
with whom I had the chance to collaborate during this thesis. The study of the
human walking with the Cognac-G team have been a thrilling experience and I have
enjoyed my interactions with medical doctors: Damien Ricard, Pierre-Paul
Vidal, Alain Yelnik, Catherine De Waele, Stéphane Buffat, Alfredo Pulini, Clément
Provost and a special note for Remi Barrois-Müller, with whom I shared the hardship of
robust "data annotation". I would also like to thanks Pierre-Paul Vidal, Matthieu Robert,
Emile Contal, Pierre Humbert and Ludovic Minvielle for the Oculo project, which has
been very instructive and exciting.

A big thanks to everyone that have been supporting me for these past three
years. Many thanks to my colleagues at CMLA, Julien, Thomas, Mathilde, Pierre, Argyris,
Batiste, Rémi D, Rémi L, Myrto, Steven, Ludo, Alice, Kévin, Mounir, Ioannis, Juan and Asma
for the good mood in the lab and thanks to Cedric and Charles, for sharing this three year
adventure, with its ups and downs. Also, many thanks to my friends for all the energy they
gave me, les volleyeurs, la Kès, Youmpi and the Brocoloc. A special thought goes to Alexandre,
Coralie and Hugo, who were always there when I needed the most. To my family, who always
pushed me to go higher and to achieve my goals, I am very grateful that you supported me
for all these years. Finally, thank you Marine for sharing my life during this adventure
and being here for me.
