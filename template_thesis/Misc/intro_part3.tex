	During my PhD, I collaborated with medical doctors for clinical research purposes,
	developing tools to help them analyze their physiological signal data. This collaboration
	has been centered around two projects, the study of the walk for adults and the study
	of the eye movements for young infants. This part presents results obtained as part of this
	collaboration.
